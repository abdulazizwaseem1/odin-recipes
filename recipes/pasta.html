        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Mushroom Shrimp Alfredo Pasta is a rich, creamy, and indulgent dish that combines tender fettuccine with
        a velvety Alfredo sauce, savory mushrooms, and succulent shrimp. The recipe begins with cooking pasta until
        al dente, then tossing it in a sauce made from butter, heavy cream, Romano, and Parmesan cheeses, infused with
        garlic for depth of flavor. Meanwhile, onions and mushrooms are sautéed until soft and aromatic, before shrimp is added
        and cooked to a perfect pink. The shrimp and mushroom mixture is folded into the Alfredo sauce, coating the pasta in a
        luxurious blend of creaminess and umami. Finished with a sprinkle of parsley, this dish balances the richness of the 
        sauce with the earthiness of mushrooms and the delicate sweetness of shrimp, making it a comforting yet elegant meal ideal 
        for weeknight dinners or special occasions.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) box dry fettuccine pasta</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 pint heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>¾ cup grated Romano cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed, divided</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
            <li>8 ounces diced mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package frozen shrimp, deveined and tails removed, thawed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over medium heat. Stir in fettuccine, return to a boil, and cook until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and keep warm.</li>
            <li>While the fettuccine is cooking, heat 1 cup butter and cream in a large saucepan over medium heat. When butter melts, add Romano, Parmesan, 1/3 of the garlic, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until cheese melts and sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>At the same time, heat remaining 1/4 cup butter and olive oil in another saucepan over medium heat. When butter melts, add onion; cook and stir until softened and translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in mushrooms and remaining garlic; increase the heat to medium-high and cook until mushrooms are soft, about 2 minutes. Add shrimp and cook until bright pink on the outside and opaque in the center, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Fold shrimp mixture into sauce. Add drained fettuccine and toss to coat.</li>
        </ol>
