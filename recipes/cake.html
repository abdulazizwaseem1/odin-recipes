        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This classic Red Velvet Cake recipe is a festive, crowd-pleasing dessert known for its vibrant red hue,
        tender crumb, and rich flavor. It begins by creaming sugar and shortening, then blending in eggs and 
        a cocoa-red food coloring paste for its signature color. Buttermilk, flour, and a touch of vinegar and
        baking soda are added to create a moist, fluffy texture with a subtle tang. The cake is baked in two
        9-inch layers and cooled before being frosted with a unique cooked flour icing which is made by thickening milk
        and flour, then whipping it with butter, sugar, and vanilla until light and creamy. The result is a nostalgic,
        velvety cake with a smooth, not-too-sweet frosting that's perfect for holidays or special occasions.</p>

            <li>2 ½ cups sifted all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Icing:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch round pans.</li>
            <li>Make the cake: Beat 1 1/2 cups sugar and shortening together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine red food coloring and cocoa to make a paste; add to creamed mixture.</li>
            <li>Mix buttermilk, salt, and 1 teaspoon vanilla together in a small bowl. Add flour, alternating with buttermilk mixture, mixing just until incorporated.</li>
            <li>Mix vinegar and baking soda together; gently fold into cake batter and pour into prepared pans.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Make the icing: Heat milk and flour in a saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly, until thick. Set aside to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, beat sugar, butter, and vanilla together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add cooled flour mixture and beat until frosting is a good spreading consistency. Frost cake layers when completely cool.</li>
        </ol>
