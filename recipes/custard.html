        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Simple Custard is a smooth, creamy dessert that highlights the comforting flavors of milk, eggs, sugar, and vanilla.
        This recipe gently cooks milk with sugar until warm, then slowly incorporates beaten eggs to create a silky mixture without
        curdling. Vanilla extract is added for aroma and flavor, and the custard is cooked over low heat until thickened to a luscious
        consistency. The result is a versatile treat that can be enjoyed on its own, poured over fruit, or used as a filling for pastries.
        Its delicate sweetness and velvety texture make it a timeless classic, perfect for both everyday indulgence and special occasions.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Place milk, vanilla extract, and butter in a saucepan.</li>

            <li>Allow to cool before chilling. Enjoy!</li>
